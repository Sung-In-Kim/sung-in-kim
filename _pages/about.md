Welcome! I am a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University. I study comparative political economy and political behavior. My dissertation explores the political consequences of economic shocks and structural economic changes in advanced democracies, focusing on deindustrialization, green transitions, and recessions. You can find my CV [here](https://sung-in-kim.github.io/files/CV_SungInKim.pdf).
